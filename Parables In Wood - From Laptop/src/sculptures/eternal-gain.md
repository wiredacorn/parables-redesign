  West Texas Juniper on Mesquite


  To showcase this exquisite sculpture, Chris ultimately decided to install it on a large 7' base of juniper and alabaster creating an entirely new perspective.


  The flowing head dress of the plains Indians epitomize the regalia of these native Americans possibly more than any other symbol.  These elaborate crowns were composed of individual memorials to brave and noteworthy deeds. However like all of our "best", it fades quickly in the eyes of eternity.

  Starting at the left side of the sculpture there is a continuous pattern of growth rings (age indication). I counted close to 400 pairs of rings (light-dark) from his shoulder to the dark streak that runs through his left eye.  This was a sizable tree when Columbus first sailed to America.


  However like all of our "best", it fades quickly in the eyes of eternity. The weathered wood shown where the torso cuts off is in stark contrast to the polished wood. Any good sculpture is both interesting and beautiful from any view.  Note the movement and flow created by the head dress.  The grain is also particularly beautiful.
poem: |-
  Crown of feathers at your feet
  fading in the sands of time
  my best a pile of "righteous" dust
  ill-equipped to make the climb

  into your Holy presence
  where eternal treasures lay
  trusting my strength and trophies
  proves a futile hopeless way.

  Each plume a proud memorial
  of some accomplished deed
  set upon my head at times
  for every eye to read.

  Oh Lord please help me to perceive
  my victories and pains,
  as what they are in heaven's eyes,
  eternal loss and gains.

  Then daily help me reckon
  every trophy as a loss,
  unless it brings you glory,
  and keeps me kneeling at the cross.
