introsubtitle: Stylized bronze, wood, and stone sculptures
introtext: >-
  Fluid, interpretive wood sculptures, moving depictions of a wide variety of
  subjects. An unique array of medium; rare woods, gem quality wood grains,
  alabaster and semi-precious stone, even a new medium, Bronzewood Meld. The
  message of each sculpture augmented by custom poetry.


  The subjects of Whites work include, but are not limited to; human form, birds animals, aquatic subjects, Western Art, horses and contemporary abstract forms. Each of White's sculptures expresses a Christian message when it is coupled with a poem written expressly for that sculpture.


  > Creation is a lens through which we can see God, true enough. Still the optics are greatly improved by seeking Him in His Word. Jesus coupled the two together in His parables. So, in effect, I am following His example. These sculptures are, quite simply, Parables in Wood.


  By definition, one of a kind sculpture excludes the concept of multiples and contains the value of uniqueness and rarity. White's sculptures become even more singular when the medium of their expression is taken into consideration. Long hours of hunting precariously rugged Texas canyons for exceptional grain patterns, shapes and forms found in dead standing trees, produce the unequalled beauty of the woods that comprise White's sculptures. Stooping and crawling through miles of underground alabaster caves in search of unique stones provides beautiful water carved textures and forms, the raw materials for his Bronzestone Melds.


  In recent years one of White's childhood dreams of sculpting semi-precious stones has become a reality. The added beauty of Lapis Lazuli and unique specimens of Marra Mamba Tiger Eye bring added beauty and rarity to this new component of his sculptures.


  > If I am going to spend countless hours on an expression of beauty, it only makes sense to start with something already extremely beautiful and work from there.
